# Noisy voter model for the parliamentary presence

Here you can find Python implementation of the noisy voter model for the
parliamentary presence. This variation of the noisy voter model differs from
the other variations in having two states: the true state (which corresponds to
intent) and the observed state (which corresponds to action).

This model was introduced in forthcoming article "Noisy voter model for the
anomalous diffusion of parliamentary presence" by A. Kononovicius (reference
to the paper will be added later).
